  heading="Frequently Asked Questions"
  faqs={[
    {
      question: "When should I get my EV systems calibrated?",
      answer:
        "System calibration is recommended after a collision, module replacement, software update, or if you notice performance inconsistencies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What systems are included in the diagnostics?",
      answer:
        "We check battery management systems, electric drive units, sensor arrays, ECUs, and more, depending on the vehicle make.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is calibration only for advanced driver-assist systems?",
      answer:
        "No. While ADAS calibration is critical, we also calibrate thermal systems, steering, regenerative braking, and charging components.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the diagnostic and calibration process take?",
      answer:
        "Most diagnostics are completed in a few hours. If calibration is required, the timeline depends on the system and EV model.",
